    <h1>Problems Faced and Solutions</h1>
    
    <h2>1. Understanding Class Structure</h2>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Initially, it was unclear how to structure multiple classes effectively.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Provided a structured breakdown with separate files for each class.</p>
    
    <h2>2. Implementing Inheritance</h2>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Unsure how to extend the Employee class into a Manager class with additional attributes.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Demonstrated class inheritance with `super()` and how to manage subordinates.</p>
    
    <h2>3. Managing Employees in a Department</h2>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Needed a way to store and manage multiple Employee instances within a Department.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Used lists and implemented methods to add employees and count total employees.</p>
    
    <h2>4. Associating Employees with Projects</h2>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Confusion on how to associate employees with a project.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Introduced a `Project` class that holds a list of assigned employees.</p>
    
    <h2>5. Creating a Company Structure</h2>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Unsure how to integrate departments, projects, and employees into a company structure.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Developed a `Company` class that holds multiple departments and provides summaries.</p>
    
    <h2>6. Serializing Classes for Better Organization</h2>
    <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Wanted an easy way to differentiate each file and function.</p>
    <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Numbered each file and added structured comments to maintain clarity.</p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>1. Organizing Multiple Python Files</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Initially, all the code was in a single script, making it difficult to manage and navigate.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I helped you separate the code into multiple files based on functionality, such as <code>book.py</code>, <code>vector.py</code>, and <code>file_open.py</code>.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>2. Implementing Abstract Classes</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> You needed help creating an abstract base class for <code>Shape</code> and its derived classes.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I guided you in using the <code>ABC</code> module and defining abstract methods correctly.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>3. Using Dunder Methods Effectively</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> You needed to implement methods like <code>__str__</code>, <code>__repr__</code>, and arithmetic dunder methods.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I provided structured implementations for <code>Vector</code> and <code>Book</code> classes with appropriate dunder methods.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>4. Creating a Class Decorator</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> You wanted to add new functionality to a class dynamically.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I demonstrated how to use decorators to inject methods into a class.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>5. Enforcing Interface Implementation</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> You wanted to ensure that subclasses implemented specific methods.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I guided you in creating an interface using <code>ABC</code> and ensuring compliance in subclasses.</p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="section">
        <h2>6. Handling Context Managers</h2>
        <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Managing file operations efficiently.</p>
        <p><strong>Solution:</strong> I helped implement a context manager class <code>FileOpen</code> to handle file operations using <code>__enter__</code> and <code>__exit__</code>.</p>
    </div>
    
    <p><strong>Overall Outcome:</strong> You now have well-structured, maintainable Python code that implements various advanced class concepts efficiently!</p>
